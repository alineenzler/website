According to our current rhythm a game event takes place twice a month. Mostly we try to stick to the first and third Saturday, the exact dates can be found on the front page.

* Our events are public and everyone is welcome.
* Usually there's no set program and you can come and go as you please.

However, we try to make our events more fun with exciting activities and give you the opportunity to discover new things.
Such activities are always mentioned in the calendar, such as role-play rounds or tournaments (p.ex. X-Wing).

## Join in!

In order to offer a varied programme, we are open to your suggestions:

### Our infrastructure

Thanks to our partnership with the parish of St. Johannes Lucerne, we have access to various premises, suitable for any size. If we plan early enough, we can organize access to enough tables, kitchen, beamer and much more.

We are looking forward to your ideas.
