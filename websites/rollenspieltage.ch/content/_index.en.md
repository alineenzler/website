_The Luzerner Rollenspieltage will be held again this year, albeit in a slightly adapted form - namely online. As planned, the dates are on **29th and 30th August 2020.**_

Even if the feeling is not quite the same as in a personal role-play session, we would like to take the opportunity to hold the Rollenspieltage this year as well. **Role-playing games can be played online well and without much equipment.** All you need is a computer with internet connection and a microphone.

**For us the community feeling is very important** and we will try to create a platform where we can meet and talk between the rounds of the games.

This format can be a challenge, especially for players and gamemasters who have no experience with online pen & paper. **We, the organizers will be there for you before and during the event to help with technical questions and uncertainties.**
