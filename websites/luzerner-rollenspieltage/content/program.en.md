# Role-playing rounds

As soon as the first rounds (and also workshops) are set, we will switch the program live and you can register here.

We recommend that you subscribe to our [newsletter]({{< ref "newsletter" >}}).

## Time table

# Workshops and discussions

Already in the first edition of the _Luzerner Rollenspieltage_ there were opportunities to exchange ideas. We have planned this for this year as well.

_These agenda items will also be published soon._

# Flea market

We would like to provide a flea market area this year. Every visitor of the _Rollenspieltage_ is allowed to offer role-playing games and accessories for sale and can expand his own collection by buying books or other items from other attendees.

For simplicity's sake we plan to run the flea market only during the breaks.

# Catering

Drinks can be purchased on site. We also ensure that warm meals can be consumed.

_More information will follow._
