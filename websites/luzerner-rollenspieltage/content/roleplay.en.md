# What is a role-playing game?

A role-playing game, as played at our event, is often referred to as a tabletop role-playing game (because you play at a table) or a pen-and-paper role-playing game (because pens and paper are almost always involved).

Imagine a group of 3-5 people telling a story together. It compares well with improvisational theatre, with the addition of game rules and dice that may propel the story in an unforeseen direction.</p><p>In a classic role-playing game, one person at the table takes the role of the game master. The remaining players each take the role of a fictional character, while the game master takes care of the world where your story unfolds and the other characters that appear (so called non-player-characters).

Although it is the task of the game master to regularly challenge the characters, it's not about winning - cooperative storytelling is the focus and as long as you contribute something to the story you will feel like a winner.
