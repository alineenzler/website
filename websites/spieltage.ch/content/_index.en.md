<p style="margin: 0; margin-bottom: 5px;"><strong>Cancellation of the Luzerner Spieltage 2020</strong></p>

<p>Dear friends,</p>

<p>It is with a heavy heart that the Organising Committee has decided to <strong>cancel the Luzerner Spieltage 2020</strong>.
The decision is based on several points, which we would like to inform you openly as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li style="margin-bottom: 5px">Burden for helpers<br />
There is a general uncertainty in the population due to the Coronavirus whether one can participate in larger events. We too have already received cancellations from helpers or the wish to postpone the Spieltage. The resulting workload on the shoulders of the remaining helpers is higher than we would like to expect from our volunteers. We also do not want to morally oblige the rest of the volunteers to participate in the event.</li>

<li style="margin-bottom: 5px">Risks for the association<br />
The association has to comply with the requirements of the canton and the federation when organising the event. We are currently of the opinion that we are still able to fulfil the conditions, but a negative interpretation in the event of an incident is a legal and financial risk for the small association. Furthermore, a change of situation can lead to a tightening of the conditions. If these conditions can no longer be complied with, a cancellation at short notice would be unavoidable.</li>

<li style="margin-bottom: 5px">Risk of illness<br />
We do not want to expose any participants to an increased risk of contracting Covid-19.</li>
</ol>

<p>The Spieltage should be an event for relaxation and casual play. For the reasons mentioned above, we feel that this experience is diminished and we therefore had to make the decision to cancel.</p>

<p>We would like to thank everyone for their great interest, helpfulness and commitment. We are of course planning further events and will remain active as soon as the situation calms down again.</p>

<p><em>Your Organising Committee of the Luzerner Spieltage 2020</em></p>
